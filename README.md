# ROS 2 Overview and Usage Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of important ROS 2 concepts and commands, including rclpy, rqt, nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters, launch files, packages, workspaces, and more. Whether you're getting started with ROS 2 or need a quick refresher, this document will help you understand the key components of ROS 2 and how to use them effectively.

## Key ROS 2 Concepts

### rclpy
`rclpy` is the Python client library for ROS 2, providing the bindings to interact with the ROS 2 core. It enables developers to write ROS 2 nodes in Python, handling services, publishers, subscribers, timers, and logging.

### rqt
`rqt` is the graphical interface for ROS 2, offering tools for visualizing and interacting with ROS topics, services, parameters, and more.

### Node
A node in ROS 2 is a fundamental unit of computation. Each node performs a single, modular task (e.g., controlling motors, reading sensor data). Nodes communicate with each other using topics, services, actions, and parameters.

To get information about a specific node, use the command:
```bash
ros2 node info /my_turtle
```

### Parameter
Parameters allow you to customize the behavior of a node without changing its code. They are often used for configuration values that might change at runtime.

- Display a parameter’s value:
  ```bash
  ros2 param get <node_name> <parameter_name>
  ```
- Set a parameter’s value:
  ```bash
  ros2 param set <node_name> <parameter_name> <value>
  ```

### Topics
Topics allow nodes to send data continuously to one or more subscribers. A node may publish to any number of topics and subscribe to many topics simultaneously.

Publish data to a topic using the following:
```bash
ros2 topic pub <topic_name> <msg_type> <data>
```

### Services
Services are used for request-response communication, where a client sends a request to a server and waits for a response. Unlike topics, services are used when you need an immediate reply.

To show the structure of a service type:
```bash
ros2 interface show <service_type>
```

### Actions
Actions are similar to services but are intended for long-running tasks that allow intermediate feedback and preemption. They are used when a task may take time to finish, and you need the ability to receive updates or cancel the task.

## Working with ROS 2 Tools

### `rqt_console`
Use `rqt_console` to view and manage log messages from ROS 2 nodes in a more organized and user-friendly manner.

### `ros2 topic hz`
This command checks the frequency of a topic’s publication. For example:
```bash
ros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose
```

### `ros2 bag`
`ros2 bag` allows you to record and store data published to topics in your system:
```bash
ros2 bag record <topic_name>
```

## Package and Workspace Management

### Package
A package in ROS 2 is a unit of organization for ROS code and resources. It may include nodes, configuration files, and launch files. Use the following command to create a new package:
```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_robot_package --dependencies rclpy
```

### Workspace
A workspace is where ROS packages are stored. It consists of the following directories:
- `src`: Contains the source code for ROS packages.
- `build`: Stores intermediate files during the build process.
- `install`: Contains installed packages.
- `log`: Stores log files generated during building.

To build a workspace, use:
```bash
colcon build
```

To source the workspace setup file:
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

### `rosdep`
`rosdep` is a tool for checking and installing package dependencies. Use it to install dependencies before building your workspace:
```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

## Launching Nodes with Launch Files

### Launch Files
In ROS 2, Python launch files are used to start nodes and configure parameters. This is more flexible and powerful than the XML-based launch files used in ROS 1.

To pass arguments when launching nodes, you can use substitutions:
```bash
ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions.launch.py turtlesim_ns:='turtlesim3' use_provided_red:='True' new_background_r:=200
```

---

## Event Handlers and Process Management

### Event Handlers
Event handlers are used to react to events during the launch process. Examples of events include the completion of a process or the exit of a process. Common event handlers include:
- `OnExecutionComplete`
- `OnProcessExit`
- `OnProcessStart`
- `OnShutdown`

Event handlers enable dynamic responses during the execution of a launch file.

## Coordinate Frames and Transformations

### TF2
TF2 is the transformation library in ROS 2, used to keep track of coordinate frames and their relationships over time. It broadcasts and listens for transformations between different reference frames.

To visualize the transform tree:
```bash
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
```

To echo a transform between two frames:
```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo world turtle1
```

### Static vs Dynamic Transformations
Static transformations represent fixed relationships between coordinate frames that don't change over time (e.g., sensor positions in a robot). Dynamic transformations represent relationships that change over time (e.g., the position of a robot in a world frame).

### Euler Angles vs Quaternions
- **Euler Angles**: Use roll, pitch, and yaw to represent orientations but may suffer from gimbal lock.
- **Quaternions**: Avoid gimbal lock, use a 4D representation, and always take the shortest path for rotations.

## Understanding the File Structure

### `setup.py` vs `package.xml`
- **`setup.py`**: Defines package metadata and configuration for Python-based ROS packages. It specifies dependencies, entry points, and other settings for packaging.
- **`package.xml`**: Contains information about the package (e.g., name, version, dependencies) for ROS 2, commonly used for C++ and other language-based packages.
